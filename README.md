# Coding Practice Repository

This repository is my effort to gather all coding questions that I have came across from my interviews, assessments and coding practice questions from multiple sites. I try to clearly organize them into separate directories as I see fit (i.e. how they are logically grouped together). Furthermore, the description for each question is located either directly in my solution source code or in the case where the description is dense, in separate markdown file.
